# Random thoughts

## Morning

- JB has us go to issues and put emoji on OS, tests that we've signed into github! also sees how many windows users there are
- it's ok that things take a long time
- make things self explaining, don't spend a lot of time writing wordy explainers that you have to maintain and won't want to read later
- organize your files and keep readme up to date!
- "unless you can keep it current, don't write it"
- it helps to know about your R installation and where packages go in order to make a package
- new package `fs`, helps us work with file paths. note, don't use paste() to work with file paths like they are strings, they are not!

## Mid-morning

- turn of .RData loading and never ask to save .RData
- restart R often!
- no absolute paths
- use a stable base: `here::here("data","raw-data.csv")` in your project directory, `fs::path_home()`
- form paths at runtime relative to a stable base
- normalizePath() makes it work on both windows and mac
- Rstudio set up a mirror for downloading packages **in** the building! What!
- use `basename` instead of `strsplit` to get name of file (don't have to specify \ or /)
- name files and directories as thing_thing-info_thing2 so for instance day_session_topic so you can order and deliminate them later
