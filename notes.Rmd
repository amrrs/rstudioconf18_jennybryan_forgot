# Random thoughts

## Morning - library exploration

- JB has us go to issues and put emoji on OS, tests that we've signed into github! also sees how many windows users there are
- it's ok that things take a long time
- make things self explaining, don't spend a lot of time writing wordy explainers that you have to maintain and won't want to read later
- organize your files and keep readme up to date!
- "unless you can keep it current, don't write it"
- it helps to know about your R installation and where packages go in order to make a package
- new package `fs`, helps us work with file paths. note, don't use paste() to work with file paths like they are strings, they are not!

## Mid-morning - file copying and naming, projects

- turn of .RData loading and never ask to save .RData
- restart R often!
- no absolute paths
- use a stable base: `here::here("data","raw-data.csv")` in your project directory, `fs::path_home()`
- form paths at runtime relative to a stable base
- normalizePath() makes it work on both windows and mac
- Rstudio set up a mirror for downloading packages **in** the building! What!
- use `basename` instead of `strsplit` to get name of file (don't have to specify \ or /)
- name files and directories as thing_thing-info_thing2 so for instance day_session_topic so you can order and deliminate them later

## Side note from my own issues in moving this repo to github

How to add an existing Rstudio repo to github:

This has changed since [git 2.9](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37937984/git-refusing-to-merge-unrelated-histories), now when you add remote and then pull you need a special option.

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/jminnier/rstudioconf18_jennybryan_forgot.git
git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories
```

## Afternoon - git/github

- git is scary but you should learn the 3 things you always have to do and just do them over and over until you are comfortable ("get off the beach!")
- easier to start from github then go to rstudio (sad)
- when you clone a repo in Rstudio and copy the ssh (or https) into the prompt, then press TAB, it will auto-fill the name of the repo into the next field!
- in git commit: two yellow question marks: local file git has never seen before
- jenny commits her .Rproj (this is controversial)
- intermediate step "staging" tells git you do want these files to be part of the next commit, this way you can commit files separately
- use conventional file extensions so that github can show you customized diffs
- jenny thinks putting derived products in version control is a good idea (i.e. html from Rmds)
- jim hester will show us how github makes it easy to search code
- when using workbook button from .R files we get a html report (jenny says html maybe not best option, more later)
- oh yeah, html does not look good on github =( too raw!
- mullet: what you need to write (.R, .Rmd) = this business in front; what you want to read/see (.html, .md) = party in the back (or is it the other way around?)
- .html is not useful but .md is useful for github; use YAML:
```
#' ---
#' output: github_document
#' ---
```
- now github will render the resulting .md file this to look pretty nice!
- source only hard-liners say don't version control output (only source code). but this makes it really useful to see what the output looks like and how it changes.
