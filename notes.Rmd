# Random thoughts

- JB says: go to issues and put emoji on OS, tests that we've signed into github! also sees how many windows users there are
- it's ok that things take a long time
- make things self explaining, don't spend a lot of time writing wordy explainers that you have to maintain and won't want to read later
- organize your files and keep readme up to date!
- "unless you can keep it current, don't write it"
- it helps to know about your R installation and where packages go in order to make a package
- new package `fs`, helps us work with file paths. note, don't use paste() to work with file paths like they are strings, they are not!
